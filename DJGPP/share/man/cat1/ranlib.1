       rraannlliibb generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores it
       in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by a member of an
       archive that is a relocatable object file.

       You may use nnmm --ss or nnmm ----pprriinntt--aarrmmaapp to list this index.

       An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and
       allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
       their placement in the archive.

       The GNU rraannlliibb program is another form of GNU aarr; running rraannlliibb is
       completely equivalent to executing aarr --ss.

       --hh
       --HH
       ----hheellpp
           Show usage information for rraannlliibb.

       --vv
       --VV
       ----vveerrssiioonn
           Show the version number of rraannlliibb.

       --DD  Operate in _d_e_t_e_r_m_i_n_i_s_t_i_c mode.  The symbol map archive member's
           header will show zero for the UID, GID, and timestamp.  When this
           option is used, multiple runs will produce identical output files.

           If _b_i_n_u_t_i_l_s was configured with ----eennaabbllee--ddeetteerrmmiinniissttiicc--aarrcchhiivveess,
           then this mode is on by default.  It can be disabled with the --UU
           option, described below.

       --tt  Update the timestamp of the symbol map of an archive.

       --UU  Do _n_o_t operate in _d_e_t_e_r_m_i_n_i_s_t_i_c mode.  This is the inverse of the
           --DD option, above: the archive index will get actual UID, GID,
           timestamp, and file mode values.

           If _b_i_n_u_t_i_l_s was configured _w_i_t_h_o_u_t ----eennaabbllee--ddeetteerrmmiinniissttiicc--aarrcchhiivveess,
           then this mode is on by default.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.  If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in _f_i_l_e are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
           character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
           option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including
           a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be
           included with a backslash.  The _f_i_l_e may itself contain additional
           @_f_i_l_e options; any such options will be processed recursively.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       _a_r(1), _n_m(1), and the Info entries for _b_i_n_u_t_i_l_s.
