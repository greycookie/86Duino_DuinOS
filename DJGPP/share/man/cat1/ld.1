       lldd combines a number of object and archive files,
       relocates their data and ties up symbol references.
       Usually the last step in compiling a program is to run lldd.

       lldd accepts Linker Command Language files written in a
       superset of AT&T's Link Editor Command Language syntax, to
       provide explicit and total control over the linking
       process.

       This man page does not describe the command language; see
       the lldd entry in "info" for full details on the command
       language and on other aspects of the GNU linker.

       This version of lldd uses the general purpose BFD libraries
       to operate on object files. This allows lldd to read,
       combine, and write object files in many different
       formats---for example, COFF or "a.out".  Different formats
       may be linked together to produce any available kind of
       object file.

       Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful
       than other linkers in providing diagnostic information.
       Many linkers abandon execution immediately upon
       encountering an error; whenever possible, lldd continues
       executing, allowing you to identify other errors (or, in
       some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).

       The GNU linker lldd is meant to cover a broad range of
       situations, and to be as compatible as possible with other
       linkers.  As a result, you have many choices to control
       its behavior.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The linker supports a plethora of command-line options,
       but in actual practice few of them are used in any
       particular context.  For instance, a frequent use of lldd is
       to link standard Unix object files on a standard,
       supported Unix system.  On such a system, to link a file
       "hello.o":

               ld -o <output> /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc

       This tells lldd to produce a file called _o_u_t_p_u_t as the
       result of linking the file "/lib/crt0.o" with "hello.o"
       and the library "libc.a", which will come from the
       standard search directories.  (See the discussion of the
       --ll option below.)

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


       Some of the command-line options to lldd may be specified at
       any point in the command line.  However, options which
       refer to files, such as --ll or --TT, cause the file to be
       read at the point at which the option appears in the
       command line, relative to the object files and other file
       options.  Repeating non-file options with a different
       argument will either have no further effect, or override
       prior occurrences (those further to the left on the
       command line) of that option.  Options which may be
       meaningfully specified more than once are noted in the
       descriptions below.

       Non-option arguments are object files or archives which
       are to be linked together.  They may follow, precede, or
       be mixed in with command-line options, except that an
       object file argument may not be placed between an option
       and its argument.

       Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object
       file, but you can specify other forms of binary input
       files using --ll, --RR, and the script command language.  If
       _n_o binary input files at all are specified, the linker
       does not produce any output, and issues the message NNoo
       iinnppuutt ffiilleess.

       If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object
       file, it will assume that it is a linker script.  A script
       specified in this way augments the main linker script used
       for the link (either the default linker script or the one
       specified by using --TT).  This feature permits the linker
       to link against a file which appears to be an object or an
       archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values,
       or uses "INPUT" or "GROUP" to load other objects.
       Specifying a script in this way merely augments the main
       linker script, with the extra commands placed after the
       main script; use the --TT option to replace the default
       linker script entirely, but note the effect of the
       "INSERT" command.

       For options whose names are a single letter, option
       arguments must either follow the option letter without
       intervening whitespace, or be given as separate arguments
       immediately following the option that requires them.

       For options whose names are multiple letters, either one
       dash or two can precede the option name; for example,
       --ttrraaccee--ssyymmbbooll and ----ttrraaccee--ssyymmbbooll are equivalent.
       Note---there is one exception to this rule.  Multiple
       letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can only
       be preceded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion
       with the --oo option.  So for example --oommaaggiicc sets the
       output file name to mmaaggiicc whereas ----oommaaggiicc sets the NMAGIC
       flag on the output.

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


       Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be
       separated from the option name by an equals sign, or be
       given as separate arguments immediately following the
       option that requires them.  For example, ----ttrraaccee--ssyymmbbooll
       ffoooo and ----ttrraaccee--ssyymmbbooll==ffoooo are equivalent.  Unique
       abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
       accepted.

       Note---if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a
       compiler driver (e.g. ggcccc) then all the linker command
       line options should be prefixed by --WWll,, (or whatever is
       appropriate for the particular compiler driver) like this:

                 gcc -Wl,--start-group foo.o bar.o -Wl,--end-group

       This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver
       program may silently drop the linker options, resulting in
       a bad link.  Confusion may also arise when passing options
       that require values through a driver, as the use of a
       space between option and argument acts as a separator, and
       causes the driver to pass only the option to the linker
       and the argument to the compiler.  In this case, it is
       simplest to use the joined forms of both single- and
       multiple-letter options, such as:

                 gcc foo.o bar.o -Wl,-eENTRY -Wl,-Map=a.map

       Here is a table of the generic command line switches
       accepted by the GNU linker:

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are inserted in place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.
           If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or cannot be read, then the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in _f_i_l_e are separated by whitespace.  A
           whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in either single or
           double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included by prefixing the character to be
           included with a backslash.  The _f_i_l_e may itself
           contain additional @_f_i_l_e options; any such options
           will be processed recursively.

       --aa _k_e_y_w_o_r_d
           This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility.  The
           _k_e_y_w_o_r_d argument must be one of the strings aarrcchhiivvee,
           sshhaarreedd, or ddeeffaauulltt.  --aaaarrcchhiivvee is functionally
           equivalent to --BBssttaattiicc, and the other two keywords are
           functionally equivalent to --BBddyynnaammiicc.  This option may
           be used any number of times.

       ----aauuddiitt _A_U_D_I_T_L_I_B
           Adds _A_U_D_I_T_L_I_B to the "DT_AUDIT" entry of the dynamic
           section.  _A_U_D_I_T_L_I_B is not checked for existence, nor
           will it use the DT_SONAME specified in the library.
           If specified multiple times "DT_AUDIT" will contain a
           colon separated list of audit interfaces to use. If
           the linker finds an object with an audit entry while
           searching for shared libraries, it will add a
           corresponding "DT_DEPAUDIT" entry in the output file.
           This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms
           supporting the rtld-audit interface.

       --AA _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e
       ----aarrcchhiitteeccttuurree==_a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e
           In the current release of lldd, this option is useful
           only for the Intel 960 family of architectures.  In
           that lldd configuration, the _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e argument
           identifies the particular architecture in the 960
           family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
           archive-library search path.

           Future releases of lldd may support similar
           functionality for other architecture families.

       --bb _i_n_p_u_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
       ----ffoorrmmaatt==_i_n_p_u_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
           lldd may be configured to support more than one kind of
           object file.  If your lldd is configured this way, you
           can use the --bb option to specify the binary format for
           input object files that follow this option on the
           command line.  Even when lldd is configured to support
           alternative object formats, you don't usually need to
           specify this, as lldd should be configured to expect as
           a default input format the most usual format on each
           machine.  _i_n_p_u_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t is a text string, the name of a
           particular format supported by the BFD libraries.
           (You can list the available binary formats with
           oobbjjdduummpp --ii.)

           You may want to use this option if you are linking
           files with an unusual binary format.  You can also use
           --bb to switch formats explicitly (when linking object
           files of different formats), by including --bb _i_n_p_u_t_-
           _f_o_r_m_a_t before each group of object files in a
           particular format.

           The default format is taken from the environment
           variable "GNUTARGET".

           You can also define the input format from a script,
           using the command "TARGET";

       ----mmrrii--ssccrriipptt==_M_R_I_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_f_i_l_e
           For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, lldd
           accepts script files written in an alternate,
           restricted command language, described in the MRI
           Compatible Script Files section of GNU ld
           documentation.  Introduce MRI script files with the
           option --cc; use the --TT option to run linker scripts
           written in the general-purpose lldd scripting language.
           If _M_R_I_-_c_m_d_f_i_l_e does not exist, lldd looks for it in the
           directories specified by any --LL options.

       --dd
       --ddcc
       --ddpp These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are
           supported for compatibility with other linkers.  They
           assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable
           output file is specified (with --rr).  The script
           command "FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION" has the same effect.

       ----ddeeppaauuddiitt _A_U_D_I_T_L_I_B
       --PP _A_U_D_I_T_L_I_B
           Adds _A_U_D_I_T_L_I_B to the "DT_DEPAUDIT" entry of the
           dynamic section.  _A_U_D_I_T_L_I_B is not checked for
           existence, nor will it use the DT_SONAME specified in
           the library.  If specified multiple times
           "DT_DEPAUDIT" will contain a colon separated list of
           audit interfaces to use.  This option is only
           meaningful on ELF platforms supporting the rtld-audit
           interface.  The -P option is provided for Solaris
           compatibility.

       --ee _e_n_t_r_y
       ----eennttrryy==_e_n_t_r_y
           Use _e_n_t_r_y as the explicit symbol for beginning
           execution of your program, rather than the default
           entry point.  If there is no symbol named _e_n_t_r_y, the
           linker will try to parse _e_n_t_r_y as a number, and use
           that as the entry address (the number will be
           interpreted in base 10; you may use a leading 00xx for
           base 16, or a leading 00 for base 8).

           Specifies a list of archive libraries from which
           symbols should not be automatically exported.  The
           library names may be delimited by commas or colons.
           Specifying "--exclude-libs ALL" excludes symbols in
           all archive libraries from automatic export.  This
           option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port
           of the linker and for ELF targeted ports.  For i386
           PE, symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still
           exported, regardless of this option.  For ELF targeted
           ports, symbols affected by this option will be treated
           as hidden.

           Specifies a list of object files or archive members,
           from which symbols should not be automatically
           exported, but which should be copied wholesale into
           the import library being generated during the link.
           The module names may be delimited by commas or colons,
           and must match exactly the filenames used by lldd to
           open the files; for archive members, this is simply
           the member name, but for object files the name listed
           must include and match precisely any path used to
           specify the input file on the linker's command-line.
           This option is available only for the i386 PE targeted
           port of the linker.  Symbols explicitly listed in a
           .def file are still exported, regardless of this
           option.

       --EE
       ----eexxppoorrtt--ddyynnaammiicc
       ----nnoo--eexxppoorrtt--ddyynnaammiicc
           When creating a dynamically linked executable, using
           the --EE option or the ----eexxppoorrtt--ddyynnaammiicc option causes
           the linker to add all symbols to the dynamic symbol
           table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols
           which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.

           If you do not use either of these options (or use the
           ----nnoo--eexxppoorrtt--ddyynnaammiicc option to restore the default
           behavior), the dynamic symbol table will normally
           contain only those symbols which are referenced by
           some dynamic object mentioned in the link.

           If you use "dlopen" to load a dynamic object which
           needs to refer back to the symbols defined by the
           program, rather than some other dynamic object, then
           you will probably need to use this option when linking
           the program itself.

           You can also use the dynamic list to control what
           symbols should be added to the dynamic symbol table if
           the output format supports it.  See the description of
           ----ddyynnaammiicc--lliisstt.

           Note that this option is specific to ELF targeted
           ports.  PE targets support a similar function to
           export all symbols from a DLL or EXE; see the
           description of ----eexxppoorrtt--aallll--ssyymmbboollss below.

       --EEBB Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default

       ----aauuxxiilliiaarryy==_n_a_m_e
           When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal
           DT_AUXILIARY field to the specified name.  This tells
           the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared
           object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
           symbol table of the shared object _n_a_m_e.

           If you later link a program against this filter
           object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic
           linker will see the DT_AUXILIARY field.  If the
           dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter
           object, it will first check whether there is a
           definition in the shared object _n_a_m_e.  If there is
           one, it will be used instead of the definition in the
           filter object.  The shared object _n_a_m_e need not exist.
           Thus the shared object _n_a_m_e may be used to provide an
           alternative implementation of certain functions,
           perhaps for debugging or for machine specific
           performance.

           This option may be specified more than once.  The
           DT_AUXILIARY entries will be created in the order in
           which they appear on the command line.

       --FF _n_a_m_e
       ----ffiilltteerr==_n_a_m_e
           When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal
           DT_FILTER field to the specified name.  This tells the
           dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared
           object which is being created should be used as a
           filter on the symbol table of the shared object _n_a_m_e.

           If you later link a program against this filter
           object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic
           linker will see the DT_FILTER field.  The dynamic
           linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol
           table of the filter object as usual, but it will
           actually link to the definitions found in the shared
           object _n_a_m_e.  Thus the filter object can be used to
           select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
           _n_a_m_e.

           Some older linkers used the --FF option throughout a
           compilation toolchain for specifying object-file
           format for both input and output object files.  The
           GNU linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
           --bb, ----ffoorrmmaatt, ----ooffoorrmmaatt options, the "TARGET" command
           in linker scripts, and the "GNUTARGET" environment
           variable.  The GNU linker will ignore the --FF option
           when not creating an ELF shared object.

           Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using
           the GP register to _s_i_z_e.  This is only meaningful for
           object file formats such as MIPS ELF that support
           putting large and small objects into different
           sections.  This is ignored for other object file
           formats.

           When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal
           DT_SONAME field to the specified name.  When an
           executable is linked with a shared object which has a
           DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the
           dynamic linker will attempt to load the shared object
           specified by the DT_SONAME field rather than the using
           the file name given to the linker.

       --ii  Perform an incremental link (same as option --rr).

       ----lliibbrraarryy==_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c
           Add the archive or object file specified by _n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c
           to the list of files to link.  This option may be used
           any number of times.  If _n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c is of the form
           _:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, lldd will search the library path for a file
           called _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, otherwise it will search the library
           path for a file called _l_i_b_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c_._a.

           On systems which support shared libraries, lldd may also
           search for files other than _l_i_b_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c_._a.
           Specifically, on ELF and SunOS systems, lldd will search
           a directory for a library called _l_i_b_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c_._s_o before
           searching for one called _l_i_b_n_a_m_e_s_p_e_c_._a.  (By
           convention, a ".so" extension indicates a shared
           library.)  Note that this behavior does not apply to
           _:_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, which always specifies a file called
           _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

           The linker will search an archive only once, at the
           location where it is specified on the command line.
           If the archive defines a symbol which was undefined in
           some object which appeared before the archive on the
           command line, the linker will include the appropriate
           file(s) from the archive.  However, an undefined
           symbol in an object appearing later on the command
           line will not cause the linker to search the archive
           again.

           See the --(( option for a way to force the linker to
           search archives multiple times.

           You may list the same archive multiple times on the
           command line.

           This type of archive searching is standard for Unix
           linkers.  However, if you are using lldd on AIX, note
           that it is different from the behaviour of the AIX
           linker.

       --LL _s_e_a_r_c_h_d_i_r
       ----lliibbrraarryy--ppaatthh==_s_e_a_r_c_h_d_i_r
           Add path _s_e_a_r_c_h_d_i_r to the list of paths that lldd will
           search for archive libraries and lldd control scripts.
           You may use this option any number of times.  The
           directories are searched in the order in which they
           are specified on the command line.  Directories
           specified on the command line are searched before the
           default directories.  All --LL options apply to all --ll
           options, regardless of the order in which the options
           appear.  --LL options do not affect how lldd searches for
           a linker script unless --TT option is specified.

           If _s_e_a_r_c_h_d_i_r begins with "=", then the "=" will be
           replaced by the _s_y_s_r_o_o_t _p_r_e_f_i_x, controlled by the
           ----ssyyssrroooott option, or specified when the linker is
           configured.

           The default set of paths searched (without being
           specified with --LL) depends on which emulation mode lldd
           is using, and in some cases also on how it was
           configured.

           The paths can also be specified in a link script with
           the "SEARCH_DIR" command.  Directories specified this
           way are searched at the point in which the linker
           script appears in the command line.

           available emulations with the ----vveerrbboossee or --VV options.

           If the --mm option is not used, the emulation is taken

           from the "LDEMULATION" environment variable, if that
           is defined.

           Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the
           linker was configured.

       --MM
       ----pprriinntt--mmaapp
           Print a link map to the standard output.  A link map
           provides information about the link, including the
           following:

           +o   Where object files are mapped into memory.

           +o   How common symbols are allocated.

           +o   All archive members included in the link, with a
               mention of the symbol which caused the archive
               member to be brought in.

           +o   The values assigned to symbols.

               Note - symbols whose values are computed by an
               expression which involves a reference to a
               previous value of the same symbol may not have
               correct result displayed in the link map.  This is
               because the linker discards intermediate results
               and only retains the final value of an expression.
               Under such circumstances the linker will display
               the final value enclosed by square brackets.  Thus
               for example a linker script containing:

                          foo = 1
                          foo = foo * 4
                          foo = foo + 8

               will produce the following output in the link map
               if the --MM option is used:

                          0x00000001                foo = 0x1
                          [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo * 0x4)
                          [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo + 0x8)

       ----oommaaggiicc
           Set the text and data sections to be readable and
           writable.  Also, do not page-align the data segment,
           and disable linking against shared libraries.  If the
           output format supports Unix style magic numbers, mark
           the output as "OMAGIC". Note: Although a writable text
           section is allowed for PE-COFF targets, it does not
           conform to the format specification published by
           Microsoft.

       ----nnoo--oommaaggiicc
           This option negates most of the effects of the --NN
           option.  It sets the text section to be read-only, and
           forces the data segment to be page-aligned.  Note -
           this option does not enable linking against shared
           libraries.  Use --BBddyynnaammiicc for this.

       --oo _o_u_t_p_u_t
       ----oouuttppuutt==_o_u_t_p_u_t
           Use _o_u_t_p_u_t as the name for the program produced by lldd;
           if this option is not specified, the name _a_._o_u_t is
           used by default.  The script command "OUTPUT" can also
           specify the output file name.

       --OO _l_e_v_e_l
           If _l_e_v_e_l is a numeric values greater than zero lldd
           optimizes the output.  This might take significantly
           longer and therefore probably should only be enabled
           for the final binary.  At the moment this option only
           affects ELF shared library generation.  Future
           releases of the linker may make more use of this
           option.  Also currently there is no difference in the
           linker's behaviour for different non-zero values of
           this option.  Again this may change with future
           releases.

       ----ppuusshh--ssttaattee
           The ----ppuusshh--ssttaattee allows to preserve the current state
           of the flags which govern the input file handling so
           that they can all be restored with one corresponding
           ----ppoopp--ssttaattee option.

           The option which are covered are: --BBddyynnaammiicc, --BBssttaattiicc,
           --ddnn, --ddyy, --ccaallll__sshhaarreedd, --nnoonn__sshhaarreedd, --ssttaattiicc, --NN, --nn,

           One target for this option are specifications for _p_k_g_-
           _c_o_n_f_i_g.  When used with the ----lliibbss option all possibly
           needed libraries are listed and then possibly linked
           with all the time.  It is better to return something
           as follows:

                   -Wl,--push-state,--as-needed -libone -libtwo -Wl,--pop-state

           Undoes the effect of --push-state, restores the
           previous values of the flags governing input file
           handling.

       --qq
       ----eemmiitt--rreellooccss
           Leave relocation sections and contents in fully linked
           executables.  Post link analysis and optimization
           tools may need this information in order to perform
           correct modifications of executables.  This results in
           larger executables.

           This option is currently only supported on ELF
           platforms.

       ----ffoorrccee--ddyynnaammiicc
           Force the output file to have dynamic sections.  This
           option is specific to VxWorks targets.

       --rr
       ----rreellooccaattaabbllee
           Generate relocatable output---i.e., generate an output
           file that can in turn serve as input to lldd.  This is
           often called _p_a_r_t_i_a_l _l_i_n_k_i_n_g.  As a side effect, in
           environments that support standard Unix magic numbers,
           this option also sets the output file's magic number
           to "OMAGIC".  If this option is not specified, an
           absolute file is produced.  When linking C++ programs,
           this option _w_i_l_l _n_o_t resolve references to
           constructors; to do that, use --UUrr.

           When an input file does not have the same format as
           the output file, partial linking is only supported if
           that input file does not contain any relocations.
           Different output formats can have further
           restrictions; for example some "a.out"-based formats
           do not support partial linking with input files in
           other formats at all.

           This option does the same thing as --ii.

       --RR _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
       ----jjuusstt--ssyymmbboollss==_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           Read symbol names and their addresses from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e,
           but do not relocate it or include it in the output.
           This allows your output file to refer symbolically to
           absolute locations of memory defined in other
           programs.  You may use this option more than once.

           For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the --RR
           option is followed by a directory name, rather than a
           file name, it is treated as the --rrppaatthh option.

       ----ssttrriipp--ddeebbuugg
           Omit debugger symbol information (but not all symbols)
           from the output file.

       --tt
       ----ttrraaccee

       ----ssccrriipptt==_s_c_r_i_p_t_f_i_l_e
           Use _s_c_r_i_p_t_f_i_l_e as the linker script.  This script
           replaces lldd's default linker script (rather than
           adding to it), so _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_f_i_l_e must specify everything
           necessary to describe the output file.    If
           _s_c_r_i_p_t_f_i_l_e does not exist in the current directory,
           "ld" looks for it in the directories specified by any
           preceding --LL options.  Multiple --TT options accumulate.

       --ddTT _s_c_r_i_p_t_f_i_l_e

           Use _s_c_r_i_p_t_f_i_l_e as the default linker script.

           This option is similar to the ----ssccrriipptt option except
           that processing of the script is delayed until after
           the rest of the command line has been processed.  This
           allows options placed after the ----ddeeffaauulltt--ssccrriipptt
           option on the command line to affect the behaviour of
           the linker script, which can be important when the
           linker command line cannot be directly controlled by
           the user.  (eg because the command line is being
           constructed by another tool, such as ggcccc).

       --uu _s_y_m_b_o_l
       ----uunnddeeffiinneedd==_s_y_m_b_o_l
           Force _s_y_m_b_o_l to be entered in the output file as an
           undefined symbol.  Doing this may, for example,
           trigger linking of additional modules from standard
           libraries.  --uu may be repeated with different option
           arguments to enter additional undefined symbols.  This
           option is equivalent to the "EXTERN" linker script
           command.

       --UUrr For anything other than C++ programs, this option is
           equivalent to --rr: it generates relocatable
           output---i.e., an output file that can in turn serve
           as input to lldd.  When linking C++ programs, --UUrr _d_o_e_s
           resolve references to constructors, unlike --rr.  It
           does not work to use --UUrr on files that were themselves

           linked with --UUrr; once the constructor table has been
           built, it cannot be added to.  Use --UUrr only for the
           last partial link, and --rr for the others.

       ----uunniiqquuee[[==_S_E_C_T_I_O_N]]
           Creates a separate output section for every input
           section matching _S_E_C_T_I_O_N, or if the optional wildcard
           _S_E_C_T_I_O_N argument is missing, for every orphan input
           section.  An orphan section is one not specifically
           mentioned in a linker script.  You may use this option
           multiple times on the command line;  It prevents the
           normal merging of input sections with the same name,
           overriding output section assignments in a linker
           script.

       --vv
       ----vveerrssiioonn
       --VV  Display the version number for lldd.  The --VV option also
           lists the supported emulations.

       --xx
       ----ddiissccaarrdd--aallll

       --XX
       ----ddiissccaarrdd--llooccaallss
           Delete all temporary local symbols.  (These symbols
           start with system-specific local label prefixes,
           typically ..LL for ELF systems or LL for traditional
           a.out systems.)

       ----ttrraaccee--ssyymmbbooll==_s_y_m_b_o_l
           Print the name of each linked file in which _s_y_m_b_o_l
           appears.  This option may be given any number of
           times.  On many systems it is necessary to prepend an
           underscore.

           This option is useful when you have an undefined
           symbol in your link but don't know where the reference
           is coming from.

       --YY _p_a_t_h
           Add _p_a_t_h to the default library search path.  This

               runtime initialization of any other objects
               brought into the process at the same time.
               Similarly the runtime finalization of the object
               will occur after the runtime finalization of any
               other objects.

           iinntteerrppoossee

               shared library is linked to using dlopen, instead
               of deferring function call resolution to the point
               when the function is first called.

           The specified archives are searched repeatedly until
           no new undefined references are created.  Normally, an
           archive is searched only once in the order that it is
           specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that
           archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol
           referred to by an object in an archive that appears
           later on the command line, the linker would not be
           able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the
           archives, they all be searched repeatedly until all
           possible references are resolved.

           Using this option has a significant performance cost.
           It is best to use it only when there are unavoidable
           circular references between two or more archives.

           Tells the linker to accept input files whose
           architecture cannot be recognised.  The assumption is
           that the user knows what they are doing and
           deliberately wants to link in these unknown input
           files.  This was the default behaviour of the linker,
           before release 2.14.  The default behaviour from
           release 2.14 onwards is to reject such input files,
           and so the ----aacccceepptt--uunnkknnoowwnn--iinnppuutt--aarrcchh option has been
           added to restore the old behaviour.

       ----nnoo--aass--nneeeeddeedd
           This option affects ELF DT_NEEDED tags for dynamic
           libraries mentioned on the command line after the
           ----aass--nneeeeddeedd option.  Normally the linker will add a
           DT_NEEDED tag for each dynamic library mentioned on
           the command line, regardless of whether the library is
           actually needed or not.  ----aass--nneeeeddeedd causes a
           DT_NEEDED tag to only be emitted for a library that _a_t
           _t_h_a_t _p_o_i_n_t _i_n _t_h_e _l_i_n_k satisfies a non-weak undefined
           symbol reference from a regular object file or, if the
           library is not found in the DT_NEEDED lists of other
           needed libraries, a non-weak undefined symbol
           reference from another needed dynamic library.  Object
           files or libraries appearing on the command line _a_f_t_e_r
           the library in question do not affect whether the
           library is seen as needed.  This is similar to the
           rules for extraction of object files from archives.

           Specify the name of a dynamic list file to the linker.
           This is typically used when creating shared libraries
           to specify a list of global symbols whose references
           shouldn't be bound to the definition within the shared
           library, or creating dynamically linked executables to
           specify a list of symbols which should be added to the
           symbol table in the executable.  This option is only
           meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared
           libraries.

           The format of the dynamic list is the same as the

           Asks the linker _n_o_t to check section addresses after
           they have been assigned to see if there are any

           check, and if it finds any overlaps it will produce
           suitable error messages.  The linker does know about,
           and does make allowances for sections in overlays.

           This option also has an effect on the resolution of
           symbols in dynamic libraries.  With

           following their DT_NEEDED tags to other libraries, in
           order to resolve symbols required by the output
           binary.  With the default setting however the
           searching of dynamic libraries that follow it will
           stop with the dynamic library itself.  No DT_NEEDED
           links will be traversed to resolve symbols.

           the standard output.

           The format of the table is intentionally simple, so
           that it may be easily processed by a script if
           necessary.  The symbols are printed out, sorted by
           name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.
           If the symbol is defined, the first file listed is the
           location of the definition.  If the symbol is defined
           as a common value then any files where this happens
           appear next.  Finally any files that reference the
           symbol are listed.

           This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to
           common symbols.  The script command
           "INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION" has the same effect.

           The ----nnoo--ddeeffiinnee--ccoommmmoonn option allows decoupling the
           decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from
           the choice of the output file type; otherwise a non-
           Relocatable output type forces assigning addresses to
           Common symbols.  Using ----nnoo--ddeeffiinnee--ccoommmmoonn allows
           Common symbols that are referenced from a shared
           library to be assigned addresses only in the main
           program.  This eliminates the unused duplicate space
           in the shared library, and also prevents any possible
           confusion over resolving to the wrong duplicate when
           there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
           paths for runtime symbol resolution.

           These options control whether to demangle symbol names
           in error messages and other output.  When the linker
           is told to demangle, it tries to present symbol names
           in a readable fashion: it strips leading underscores
           if they are used by the object file format, and
           converts C++ mangled symbol names into user readable
           names.  Different compilers have different mangling
           styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be
           used to choose an appropriate demangling style for
           your compiler.  The linker will demangle by default
           unless the environment variable CCOOLLLLEECCTT__NNOO__DDEEMMAANNGGLLEE is

           containing symbols undefined on the command-line will
           be kept, as will sections containing symbols
           referenced by dynamic objects.  Note that when
           building shared libraries, the linker must assume that
           any visible symbol is referenced.  Once this initial
           set of sections has been determined, the linker
           recursively marks as used any section referenced by

           Allows or disallows undefined symbols in shared
           libraries.  This switch is similar to ----nnoo--uunnddeeffiinneedd
           except that it determines the behaviour when the
           undefined symbols are in a shared library rather than
           a regular object file.  It does not affect how
           undefined symbols in regular object files are handled.

           The default behaviour is to report errors for any
           undefined symbols referenced in shared libraries if
           the linker is being used to create an executable, but
           to allow them if the linker is being used to create a
           shared library.

           The reasons for allowing undefined symbol references
           in shared libraries specified at link time are that:

           +o   A shared library specified at link time may not be
               the same as the one that is available at load
               time, so the symbol might actually be resolvable
               at load time.

           +o   There are some operating systems, eg BeOS and
               HPPA, where undefined symbols in shared libraries
               are normal.

               The BeOS kernel for example patches shared
               libraries at load time to select whichever
               function is most appropriate for the current
               architecture.  This is used, for example, to
               dynamically select an appropriate memset function.

           Normally lldd will give an error if you try to link
           together input files that are mismatched for some
           reason, perhaps because they have been compiled for
           different processors or for different endiannesses.
           This option tells lldd that it should silently permit
           such possible errors.  This option should only be used
           with care, in cases when you have taken some special
           action that ensures that the linker errors are
           inappropriate.

           Normally lldd will give a warning if it finds an
           incompatible library during a library search.  This
           option silences the warning.

       ----nnoo--wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee

           Retain the executable output file whenever it is still
           usable.  Normally, the linker will not produce an
           output file if it encounters errors during the link
           process; it exits without writing an output file when
           it issues any error whatsoever.

       --nnoossttddlliibb
           Only search library directories explicitly specified
           on the command line.  Library directories specified in
           linker scripts (including linker scripts specified on
           the command line) are ignored.

           lldd may be configured to support more than one kind of
           object file.  If your lldd is configured this way, you
           can use the ----ooffoorrmmaatt option to specify the binary
           format for the output object file.  Even when lldd is
           configured to support alternative object formats, you
           don't usually need to specify this, as lldd should be
           configured to produce as a default output format the
           most usual format on each machine.  _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t is a

           by the BFD libraries.  (You can list the available
           binary formats with oobbjjdduummpp --ii.)  The script command
           "OUTPUT_FORMAT" can also specify the output format,
           but this option overrides it.

       --ppiiee
       ----ppiicc--eexxeeccuuttaabbllee
           Create a position independent executable.  This is
           currently only supported on ELF platforms.  Position
           independent executables are similar to shared
           libraries in that they are relocated by the dynamic
           linker to the virtual address the OS chooses for them
           (which can vary between invocations).  Like normal
           dynamically linked executables they can be executed
           and symbols defined in the executable cannot be
           overridden by shared libraries.

       --qqmmaaggiicc
           This option is ignored for Linux compatibility.

       --QQyy This option is ignored for SVR4 compatibility.

       ----rreellaaxx
       ----nnoo--rreellaaxx
           An option with machine dependent effects.  This option
           is only supported on a few targets.

           On some platforms the ----rreellaaxx option performs target
           specific, global optimizations that become possible
           when the linker resolves addressing in the program,
           such as relaxing address modes, synthesizing new
           instructions, selecting shorter version of current
           instructions, and combining constant values.

           On some platforms these link time global optimizations
           may make symbolic debugging of the resulting
           executable impossible.  This is known to be the case
           for the Matsushita MN10200 and MN10300 family of
           processors.

           On platforms where this is not supported, ----rreellaaxx is
           accepted, but ignored.

           On platforms where ----rreellaaxx is accepted the option
           ----nnoo--rreellaaxx can be used to disable the feature.

           Retain _o_n_l_y the symbols listed in the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e,
           discarding all others.  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is simply a flat
           file, with one symbol name per line.  This option is
           especially useful in environments (such as VxWorks)
           where a large global symbol table is accumulated
           gradually, to conserve run-time memory.

           symbols, or symbols needed for relocations.

           You may only specify ----rreettaaiinn--ssyymmbboollss--ffiillee once in the
           command line.  It overrides --ss and --SS.

       --rrppaatthh==_d_i_r
           Add a directory to the runtime library search path.
           This is used when linking an ELF executable with
           shared objects.  All --rrppaatthh arguments are concatenated
           and passed to the runtime linker, which uses them to
           locate shared objects at runtime.  The --rrppaatthh option
           is also used when locating shared objects which are
           needed by shared objects explicitly included in the
           link; see the description of the --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk option.
           If --rrppaatthh is not used when linking an ELF executable,
           the contents of the environment variable "LD_RUN_PATH"
           will be used if it is defined.

           The --rrppaatthh option may also be used on SunOS.  By
           default, on SunOS, the linker will form a runtime
           search patch out of all the --LL options it is given.
           If a --rrppaatthh option is used, the runtime search path
           will be formed exclusively using the --rrppaatthh options,
           ignoring the --LL options.  This can be useful when
           using gcc, which adds many --LL options which may be on
           NFS mounted file systems.

           For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the --RR
           option is followed by a directory name, rather than a
           file name, it is treated as the --rrppaatthh option.

       --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk==_d_i_r
           When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library may
           require another.  This happens when an "ld -shared"
           link includes a shared library as one of the input
           files.

           When the linker encounters such a dependency when
           doing a non-shared, non-relocatable link, it will
           automatically try to locate the required shared
           library and include it in the link, if it is not
           included explicitly.  In such a case, the --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk
           option specifies the first set of directories to
           search.  The --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk option may specify a sequence
           of directory names either by specifying a list of
           names separated by colons, or by appearing multiple
           times.

           This option should be used with caution as it
           overrides the search path that may have been hard
           compiled into a shared library. In such a case it is
           possible to use unintentionally a different search
           path than the runtime linker would do.



binutils-2.25               2014-12-23                         26





LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


           The linker uses the following search paths to locate
           required shared libraries:

           1.  Any directories specified by --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk options.

           2.  Any directories specified by --rrppaatthh options.  The
               difference between --rrppaatthh and --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk is that
               directories specified by --rrppaatthh options are
               included in the executable and used at runtime,
               whereas the --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk option is only effective
               at link time. Searching --rrppaatthh in this way is only
               supported by native linkers and cross linkers
               which have been configured with the ----wwiitthh--ssyyssrroooott
               option.

           3.  On an ELF system, for native linkers, if the
               --rrppaatthh and --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk options were not used,
               search the contents of the environment variable
               "LD_RUN_PATH".

           4.  On SunOS, if the --rrppaatthh option was not used,
               search any directories specified using --LL options.

           5.  For a native linker, search the contents of the
               environment variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH".

           6.  For a native ELF linker, the directories in
               "DT_RUNPATH" or "DT_RPATH" of a shared library are
               searched for shared libraries needed by it. The
               "DT_RPATH" entries are ignored if "DT_RUNPATH"
               entries exist.

           7.  The default directories, normally _/_l_i_b and
               _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b.

           8.  For a native linker on an ELF system, if the file
               _/_e_t_c_/_l_d_._s_o_._c_o_n_f exists, the list of directories
               found in that file.

           If the required shared library is not found, the
           linker will issue a warning and continue with the
           link.

       --sshhaarreedd
       --BBsshhaarreeaabbllee
           Create a shared library.  This is currently only
           supported on ELF, XCOFF and SunOS platforms.  On
           SunOS, the linker will automatically create a shared
           library if the --ee option is not used and there are
           undefined symbols in the link.

           This option tells lldd to sort the common symbols by
           alignment in ascending or descending order when it
           places them in the appropriate output sections.  The
           symbol alignments considered are sixteen-byte or
           larger, eight-byte, four-byte, two-byte, and one-byte.
           This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
           alignment constraints.  If no sorting order is
           specified, then descending order is assumed.

       ----ssoorrtt--sseeccttiioonn==nnaammee

       ----sspplliitt--bbyy--ffiillee[[==_s_i_z_e]]
           Similar to ----sspplliitt--bbyy--rreelloocc but creates a new output
           section for each input file when _s_i_z_e is reached.
           _s_i_z_e defaults to a size of 1 if not given.

       ----sspplliitt--bbyy--rreelloocc[[==_c_o_u_n_t]]
           Tries to creates extra sections in the output file so
           that no single output section in the file contains
           more than _c_o_u_n_t relocations.  This is useful when
           generating huge relocatable files for downloading into
           certain real time kernels with the COFF object file
           format; since COFF cannot represent more than 65535
           relocations in a single section.  Note that this will
           fail to work with object file formats which do not
           support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split
           up individual input sections for redistribution, so if
           a single input section contains more than _c_o_u_n_t
           relocations one output section will contain that many
           relocations.  _c_o_u_n_t defaults to a value of 32768.

           some ways from the output of some existing linker.

           For example, on SunOS, lldd combines duplicate entries
           in the symbol string table.  This can reduce the size
           of an output file with full debugging information by
           over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS "dbx"
           program can not read the resulting program ("gdb" has
           no trouble).  The ----ttrraaddiittiioonnaall--ffoorrmmaatt switch tells lldd

               shared libraries, but ignore them if they come
               from regular object files.

           iiggnnoorree--iinn--sshhaarreedd--lliibbss
               Report unresolved symbols that come from regular
               object files, but ignore them if they come from
               shared libraries.  This can be useful when
               creating a dynamic binary and it is known that all
               the shared libraries that it should be referencing
               are included on the linker's command line.

           The behaviour for shared libraries on their own can
           also be controlled by the ----[[nnoo--]]aallllooww--sshhlliibb--uunnddeeffiinneedd
           option.

           Normally the linker will generate an error message for
           each reported unresolved symbol but the option
           ----wwaarrnn--uunnrreessoollvveedd--ssyymmbboollss can change this to a
           warning.

       ----vveerrbboossee[[==_N_U_M_B_E_R]]
           Display the version number for lldd and list the linker
           emulations supported.  Display which input files can
           and cannot be opened.  Display the linker script being
           used by the linker. If the optional _N_U_M_B_E_R argument >
           1, plugin symbol status will also be displayed.

           Specify the name of a version script to the linker.
           This is typically used when creating shared libraries
           to specify additional information about the version
           hierarchy for the library being created.  This option
           is only fully supported on ELF platforms which support
           shared libraries; see VVEERRSSIIOONN.  It is partially
           supported on PE platforms, which can use version
           scripts to filter symbol visibility in auto-export
           mode: any symbols marked llooccaall in the version script
           will not be exported.

       ----wwaarrnn--ccoommmmoonn
           Warn when a common symbol is combined with another
           common symbol or with a symbol definition.  Unix
           linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice, but
           linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This
           option allows you to find potential problems from
           combining global symbols.  Unfortunately, some C
           libraries use this practice, so you may get some
           warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in
           your programs.

           There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated
           here by C examples:




binutils-2.25               2014-12-23                         30





LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


           iinntt ii == 11;;
               A definition, which goes in the initialized data
               section of the output file.

           eexxtteerrnn iinntt ii;;
               An undefined reference, which does not allocate
               space.  There must be either a definition or a
               common symbol for the variable somewhere.

           iinntt ii;;
               A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more)
               common symbols for a variable, it goes in the
               uninitialized data area of the output file.  The
               linker merges multiple common symbols for the same
               variable into a single symbol.  If they are of
               different sizes, it picks the largest size.  The
               linker turns a common symbol into a declaration,
               if there is a definition of the same variable.

           The ----wwaarrnn--ccoommmmoonn option can produce five kinds of
           warnings.  Each warning consists of a pair of lines:
           the first describes the symbol just encountered, and
           the second describes the previous symbol encountered
           with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols
           will be a common symbol.

           1.  Turning a common symbol into a reference, because
               there is already a definition for the symbol.

                       <file>(<section>): warning: common of `<symbol>'
                          overridden by definition
                       <file>(<section>): warning: defined here

           2.  Turning a common symbol into a reference, because
               a later definition for the symbol is encountered.
               This is the same as the previous case, except that
               the symbols are encountered in a different order.

                       <file>(<section>): warning: definition of `<symbol>'
                          overriding common
                       <file>(<section>): warning: common is here

           3.  Merging a common symbol with a previous same-sized
               common symbol.

                       <file>(<section>): warning: multiple common
                          of `<symbol>'
                       <file>(<section>): warning: previous common is here

           4.  Merging a common symbol with a previous larger
               common symbol.

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


                       <file>(<section>): warning: common of `<symbol>'
                          overridden by larger common
                       <file>(<section>): warning: larger common is here

           5.  Merging a common symbol with a previous smaller
               common symbol.  This is the same as the previous
               case, except that the symbols are encountered in a
               different order.

                       <file>(<section>): warning: common of `<symbol>'
                          overriding smaller common
                       <file>(<section>): warning: smaller common is here

       ----wwaarrnn--ccoonnssttrruuccttoorrss
           Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is
           only useful for a few object file formats.  For
           formats like COFF or ELF, the linker can not detect
           the use of global constructors.

       ----wwaarrnn--mmuullttiippllee--ggpp
           Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in
           the output file.  This is only meaningful for certain
           processors, such as the Alpha.  Specifically, some
           processors put large-valued constants in a special
           section.  A special register (the global pointer)
           points into the middle of this section, so that
           constants can be loaded efficiently via a base-
           register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset
           in base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively
           small (e.g., 16 bits), this limits the maximum size of
           the constant pool.  Thus, in large programs, it is
           often necessary to use multiple global pointer values
           in order to be able to address all possible constants.
           This option causes a warning to be issued whenever
           this case occurs.

       ----wwaarrnn--oonnccee
           Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than
           once per module which refers to it.

       ----wwaarrnn--sseeccttiioonn--aalliiggnn
           Warn if the address of an output section is changed
           because of alignment.  Typically, the alignment will
           be set by an input section.  The address will only be
           changed if it not explicitly specified; that is, if
           the "SECTIONS" command does not specify a start
           address for the section.

       ----wwaarrnn--sshhaarreedd--tteexxttrreell
           Warn if the linker adds a DT_TEXTREL to a shared
           object.

       ----wwaarrnn--aalltteerrnnaattee--eemm
           Warn if an object has alternate ELF machine code.

       ----wwaarrnn--uunnrreessoollvveedd--ssyymmbboollss
           If the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol
           (see the option ----uunnrreessoollvveedd--ssyymmbboollss) it will normally
           generate an error.  This option makes it generate a
           warning instead.

       ----eerrrroorr--uunnrreessoollvveedd--ssyymmbboollss
           This restores the linker's default behaviour of
           generating errors when it is reporting unresolved
           symbols.

       ----wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee
           For each archive mentioned on the command line after
           the ----wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee option, include every object file
           in the archive in the link, rather than searching the
           archive for the required object files.  This is
           normally used to turn an archive file into a shared
           library, forcing every object to be included in the
           resulting shared library.  This option may be used
           more than once.

           Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc
           doesn't know about this option, so you have to use
           --WWll,,--wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee.  Second, don't forget to use
           --WWll,,--nnoo--wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee after your list of archives,
           because gcc will add its own list of archives to your
           link and you may not want this flag to affect those as
           well.

       ----wwrraapp==_s_y_m_b_o_l
           Use a wrapper function for _s_y_m_b_o_l.  Any undefined
           reference to _s_y_m_b_o_l will be resolved to
           "__wrap_symbol".  Any undefined reference to
           "__real_symbol" will be resolved to _s_y_m_b_o_l.

           This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system
           function.  The wrapper function should be called
           "__wrap_symbol".  If it wishes to call the system
           function, it should call "__real_symbol".

           Here is a trivial example:

                   void *
                   __wrap_malloc (size_t c)
                   {
                     printf ("malloc called with %zu\n", c);
                     return __real_malloc (c);
                   }

           If you link other code with this file using ----wwrraapp
           mmaalllloocc, then all calls to "malloc" will call the
           function "__wrap_malloc" instead.  The call to
           "__real_malloc" in "__wrap_malloc" will call the real
           "malloc" function.

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


           You may wish to provide a "__real_malloc" function as
           well, so that links without the ----wwrraapp option will
           succeed.  If you do this, you should not put the
           definition of "__real_malloc" in the same file as
           "__wrap_malloc"; if you do, the assembler may resolve
           the call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to
           "malloc".

       ----eehh--ffrraammee--hhddrr
           Request creation of ".eh_frame_hdr" section and ELF
           "PT_GNU_EH_FRAME" segment header.

       ----nnoo--lldd--ggeenneerraatteedd--uunnwwiinndd--iinnffoo
           Request creation of ".eh_frame" unwind info for linker
           generated code sections like PLT.  This option is on
           by default if linker generated unwind info is
           supported.

       ----eennaabbllee--nneeww--ddttaaggss
       ----ddiissaabbllee--nneeww--ddttaaggss
           This linker can create the new dynamic tags in ELF.
           But the older ELF systems may not understand them. If
           you specify ----eennaabbllee--nneeww--ddttaaggss, the new dynamic tags
           will be created as needed and older dynamic tags will
           be omitted.  If you specify ----ddiissaabbllee--nneeww--ddttaaggss, no
           new dynamic tags will be created. By default, the new
           dynamic tags are not created. Note that those options
           are only available for ELF systems.

       ----hhaasshh--ssiizzee==_n_u_m_b_e_r
           Set the default size of the linker's hash tables to a
           prime number close to _n_u_m_b_e_r.  Increasing this value
           can reduce the length of time it takes the linker to
           perform its tasks, at the expense of increasing the
           linker's memory requirements.  Similarly reducing this
           value can reduce the memory requirements at the
           expense of speed.

       ----hhaasshh--ssttyyllee==_s_t_y_l_e
           Set the type of linker's hash table(s).  _s_t_y_l_e can be
           either "sysv" for classic ELF ".hash" section, "gnu"
           for new style GNU ".gnu.hash" section or "both" for
           both the classic ELF ".hash" and new style GNU
           ".gnu.hash" hash tables.  The default is "sysv".

       ----rreedduuccee--mmeemmoorryy--oovveerrhheeaaddss
           This option reduces memory requirements at ld runtime,
           at the expense of linking speed.  This was introduced
           to select the old O(n^2) algorithm for link map file
           generation, rather than the new O(n) algorithm which
           uses about 40% more memory for symbol storage.

           Another effect of the switch is to set the default
           hash table size to 1021, which again saves memory at

           the cost of lengthening the linker's run time.  This
           is not done however if the ----hhaasshh--ssiizzee switch has been
           used.

           The ----rreedduuccee--mmeemmoorryy--oovveerrhheeaaddss switch may be also be
           used to enable other tradeoffs in future versions of
           the linker.

       ----bbuuiilldd--iidd
       ----bbuuiilldd--iidd==_s_t_y_l_e
           Request the creation of a ".note.gnu.build-id" ELF
           note section or a ".build-id" COFF section.  The
           contents of the note are unique bits identifying this
           linked file.  _s_t_y_l_e can be "uuid" to use 128 random
           bits, "sha1" to use a 160-bit SHA1 hash on the
           normative parts of the output contents, "md5" to use a
           128-bit MD5 hash on the normative parts of the output
           contents, or "0xhexstring" to use a chosen bit string
           specified as an even number of hexadecimal digits ("-"
           and ":" characters between digit pairs are ignored).
           If _s_t_y_l_e is omitted, "sha1" is used.

           The "md5" and "sha1" styles produces an identifier
           that is always the same in an identical output file,
           but will be unique among all nonidentical output
           files.  It is not intended to be compared as a
           checksum for the file's contents.  A linked file may
           be changed later by other tools, but the build ID bit
           string identifying the original linked file does not
           change.

           Passing "none" for _s_t_y_l_e disables the setting from any
           "--build-id" options earlier on the command line.

       The i386 PE linker supports the --sshhaarreedd option, which
       causes the output to be a dynamically linked library (DLL)
       instead of a normal executable.  You should name the
       output "*.dll" when you use this option.  In addition, the
       linker fully supports the standard "*.def" files, which
       may be specified on the linker command line like an object
       file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports
       symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like
       a normal object file).

       In addition to the options common to all targets, the i386
       PE linker support additional command line options that are
       specific to the i386 PE target.  Options that take values
       may be separated from their values by either a space or an
       equals sign.

           The PE variants of the Coff object format add an
           extension that permits the use of section names longer
           than eight characters, the normal limit for Coff.  By
           default, these names are only allowed in object files,
           as fully-linked executable images do not carry the
           Coff string table required to support the longer
           names.  As a GNU extension, it is possible to allow
           their use in executable images as well, or to
           (probably pointlessly!)  disallow it in object files,
           by using these two options.  Executable images
           generated with these long section names are slightly
           non-standard, carrying as they do a string table, and
           may generate confusing output when examined with non-
           GNU PE-aware tools, such as file viewers and dumpers.
           However, GDB relies on the use of PE long section
           names to find Dwarf-2 debug information sections in an
           executable image at runtime, and so if neither option
           is specified on the command-line, lldd will enable long
           section names, overriding the default and technically
           correct behaviour, when it finds the presence of debug
           information while linking an executable image and not
           stripping symbols.  [This option is valid for all PE
           targeted ports of the linker]

           If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it
           will attempt to do "fuzzy linking" by looking for
           another defined symbol that differs only in the format
           of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will resolve
           that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the
           undefined symbol "_foo" might be linked to the
           function "_foo@12", or the undefined symbol "_bar@16"
           might be linked to the function "_bar".  When the
           linker does this, it prints a warning, since it

           error condition.  However, regardless of the exact
           data type of the offending exported variable, ld will
           always detect it, issue the warning, and exit.

           There are several ways to address this difficulty,
           regardless of the data type of the exported variable:

           One way is to use --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc
           switch. This leaves the task of adjusting references
           in your client code for runtime environment, so this
           method works only when runtime environment supports
           this feature.

           A second solution is to force one of the 'constants'
           to be a variable -- that is, unknown and un-
           optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, there are
           two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's
           address) a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a
           variable.  Thus:

                   extern type extern_array[];
                   extern_array[1] -->
                      { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }

           or

                   extern type extern_array[];
                   extern_array[1] -->
                      { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }

           For structs (and most other multiword data types) the
           only option is to make the struct itself (or the long
           long, or the ...) variable:

                   extern struct s extern_struct;
                   extern_struct.field -->
                      { volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t->field }

           or

                   extern long long extern_ll;
                   extern_ll -->
                     { volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll }

           A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to
           abandon 'auto-import' for the offending symbol and
           mark it with "__declspec(dllimport)".  However, in
           practice that requires using compile-time #defines to
           indicate whether you are building a DLL, building
           client code that will link to the DLL, or merely
           building/linking to a static library.   In making the
           choice between the various methods of resolving the
           'direct address with constant offset' problem, you
           should consider typical real-world usage:

           Original:

LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


                   --foo.h
                   extern int arr[];
                   --foo.c
                   #include "foo.h"
                   void main(int argc, char **argv){
                     printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
                   }

           Solution 1:

                   --foo.h
                   extern int arr[];
                   --foo.c
                   #include "foo.h"
                   void main(int argc, char **argv){
                     /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
                     volatile int *parr = arr;
                     printf("%d\n",parr[1]);
                   }

           Solution 2:

                   --foo.h
                   /* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */
                   #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) && \
                     !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
                   #define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
                   #else
                   #define FOO_IMPORT
                   #endif
                   extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
                   --foo.c
                   #include "foo.h"
                   void main(int argc, char **argv){
                     printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
                   }

           A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your
           library to use a functional interface rather than a
           data interface for the offending variables (e.g.
           _s_e_t___f_o_o_(_) and _g_e_t___f_o_o_(_) accessor functions).  [This

           If your code contains expressions described in

           used by runtime environment to adjust references to

           Specify the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and
           optionally commit) to be used as stack for this

           Specifies the subsystem under which your program will
           execute.  The legal values for _w_h_i_c_h are "native",
           "windows", "console", "posix", and "xbox".  You may

       ----ddyynnaammiiccbbaassee
           The image base address may be relocated using address
           space layout randomization (ASLR).  This feature was
           introduced with MS Windows Vista for i386 PE targets.

       ----ffoorrcceeiinntteegg
           Code integrity checks are enforced.

       ----nnxxccoommppaatt
           The image is compatible with the Data Execution
           Prevention.  This feature was introduced with MS
           Windows XP SP2 for i386 PE targets.

       ----nnoo--iissoollaattiioonn
           Although the image understands isolation, do not
           isolate the image.

       ----nnoo--sseehh
           The image does not use SEH. No SE handler may be
           called from this image.

       ----nnoo--bbiinndd
           Do not bind this image.

       ----wwddmmddrriivveerr
           The driver uses the MS Windows Driver Model.

       ----nnoo--iinnsseerrtt--ttiimmeessttaammpp
           Insert a real timestamp into the image.  This is the
           default behaviour as it matches legacy code and it
           means that the image will work with other, proprietary
           tools.  The problem with this default is that it will
           result in slightly different images being produced
           each tiem the same sources are linked.  The option
           ----nnoo--iinnsseerrtt--ttiimmeessttaammpp can be used to insert a zero
           value for the timestamp, this ensuring that binaries
           produced from indentical sources will compare
           identically.

       The C6X uClinux target uses a binary format called DSBT to
       support shared libraries.  Each shared library in the
       system needs to have a unique index; all executables use
       an index of 0.

       ----ddssbbtt--ssiizzee _s_i_z_e
           This option sets the number of entires in the DSBT of
           the current executable or shared library to _s_i_z_e.  The
           default is to create a table with 64 entries.

       ----ddssbbtt--iinnddeexx _i_n_d_e_x
           This option sets the DSBT index of the current
           executable or shared library to _i_n_d_e_x.  The default is
           0, which is appropriate for generating executables.
           If a shared library is generated with a DSBT index of
           0, the "R_C6000_DSBT_INDEX" relocs are copied into the

           merging of adjacent exidx entries in frame unwind
           info.

       The 68HC11 and 68HC12 linkers support specific options to
       control the memory bank switching mapping and trampoline
       code generation.

       ----nnoo--ttrraammppoolliinnee
           This option disables the generation of trampoline. By
           default a trampoline is generated for each far
           function which is called using a "jsr" instruction
           (this happens when a pointer to a far function is
           taken).

       ----bbaannkk--wwiinnddooww _n_a_m_e
           This option indicates to the linker the name of the
           memory region in the MMEEMMOORRYY specification that
           describes the memory bank window.  The definition of
           such region is then used by the linker to compute
           paging and addresses within the memory window.

       The following options are supported to control handling of
       GOT generation when linking for 68K targets.

       ----ggoott==_t_y_p_e
           This option tells the linker which GOT generation
           scheme to use.  _t_y_p_e should be one of ssiinnggllee,
           nneeggaattiivvee, mmuullttiiggoott or ttaarrggeett.  For more information
           refer to the Info entry for _l_d.

       The following options are supported to control microMIPS
       instruction generation when linking for MIPS targets.

       ----iinnssnn3322
       ----nnoo--iinnssnn3322
           These options control the choice of microMIPS
           instructions used in code generated by the linker,
           such as that in the PLT or lazy binding stubs, or in
           relaxation.  If ----iinnssnn3322 is used, then the linker only
           uses 32-bit instruction encodings.  By default or if
           ----nnoo--iinnssnn3322 is used, all instruction encodings are
           used, including 16-bit ones where possible.

       You can change the behaviour of lldd with the environment
       variables "GNUTARGET", "LDEMULATION" and
       "COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE".

       "GNUTARGET" determines the input-file object format if you
       don't use --bb (or its synonym ----ffoorrmmaatt).  Its value should
       be one of the BFD names for an input format.  If there is



binutils-2.25               2014-12-23                         45





LD(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 LD(1)


       no "GNUTARGET" in the environment, lldd uses the natural
       format of the target. If "GNUTARGET" is set to "default"
       then BFD attempts to discover the input format by
       examining binary input files; this method often succeeds,
       but there are potential ambiguities, since there is no
       method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify
       object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration
       procedure for BFD on each system places the conventional
       format for that system first in the search-list, so
       ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.

       "LDEMULATION" determines the default emulation if you
       don't use the --mm option.  The emulation can affect various
       aspects of linker behaviour, particularly the default
       linker script.  You can list the available emulations with
       the ----vveerrbboossee or --VV options.  If the --mm option is not
       used, and the "LDEMULATION" environment variable is not
       defined, the default emulation depends upon how the linker
       was configured.

       Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.
       However, if "COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE" is set in the
       environment, then it will default to not demangling
       symbols.  This environment variable is used in a similar
       fashion by the "gcc" linker wrapper program.  The default
       may be overridden by the ----ddeemmaannggllee and ----nnoo--ddeemmaannggllee
       options.
