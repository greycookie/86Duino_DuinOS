       _S_e_d is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used  to  per-
       form basic text transformations on an input stream (a file
       or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar  to
       an  editor  which permits scripted edits (such as _e_d), _s_e_d
       works by making only one pass over the  input(s),  and  is
       consequently  more  efficient.  But it is _s_e_d's ability to
       filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes
       it from other types of editors.

       _S_e_d commands can be given with no addresses, in which case
       the command will be executed for all input lines; with one
       address, in which case the command will only  be  executed
       for  input  lines  which  match  that address; or with two
       addresses, in which case the command will be executed  for
       all  input  lines which match the inclusive range of lines
       starting from the first address and continuing to the sec-
       ond  address.   Three things to note about address ranges:
       the  syntax  is  _a_d_d_r_1,_a_d_d_r_2  (i.e.,  the  addresses   are



sed 4.2.2                 February 2013                         4

       separated  by  a comma); the line which _a_d_d_r_1 matched will
       always be accepted, even if _a_d_d_r_2 selects an earlier line;
       and  if  _a_d_d_r_2  is a _r_e_g_e_x_p, it will not be tested against
       the line that _a_d_d_r_1 matched.

       After the address (or address-range), and before the  com-
       mand,  a !!  may be inserted, which specifies that the com-
       mand shall only be executed if the  address  (or  address-
       range) does nnoott match.

       The following address types are supported:

       _n_u_m_b_e_r Match  only the specified line _n_u_m_b_e_r (which incre-
              ments cumulatively  across  files,  unless  the  --ss
              option is specified on the command line).

       _f_i_r_s_t~_s_t_e_p
              Match  every _s_t_e_p'th line starting with line _f_i_r_s_t.
              For example, ``sed -n 1~2p''  will  print  all  the
              odd-numbered  lines  in  the  input stream, and the
              address 2~5 will match every fifth  line,  starting
              with  the second.  _f_i_r_s_t can be zero; in this case,
              _s_e_d operates as if it were equal to _s_t_e_p.  (This is
              an extension.)

       $      Match the last line.

       /_r_e_g_e_x_p/
              Match lines matching the regular expression _r_e_g_e_x_p.

       \cc_r_e_g_e_x_pcc
              Match lines matching the regular expression _r_e_g_e_x_p.
              The cc may be any character.

       GNU _s_e_d also supports some special 2-address forms:

       0,_a_d_d_r_2
              Start  out  in "matched first address" state, until
              _a_d_d_r_2 is found.  This is similar to 1,_a_d_d_r_2, except
              that  if _a_d_d_r_2 matches the very first line of input
              the 0,_a_d_d_r_2 form will be at the end of  its  range,
              whereas  the  1,_a_d_d_r_2  form  will  still  be at the
              beginning of its range.  This works only when _a_d_d_r_2
              is a regular expression.

       _a_d_d_r_1,+_N
              Will match _a_d_d_r_1 and the _N lines following _a_d_d_r_1.

       _a_d_d_r_1,~_N
              Will  match  _a_d_d_r_1  and  the  lines following _a_d_d_r_1
              until the next line whose input line  number  is  a
              multiple of _N.
