       aaddddrr22lliinnee translates addresses into file names and line
       numbers.  Given an address in an executable or an offset
       in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the
       debugging information to figure out which file name and
       line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified
       with the --ee option.  The default is the file _a_._o_u_t.  The
       section in the relocatable object to use is specified with
       the --jj option.

       aaddddrr22lliinnee has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the
       command line, and aaddddrr22lliinnee displays the file name and
       line number for each address.

       In the second, aaddddrr22lliinnee reads hexadecimal addresses from
       standard input, and prints the file name and line number
       for each address on standard output.  In this mode,
       aaddddrr22lliinnee may be used in a pipe to convert dynamically
       chosen addresses.

       The format of the output is FFIILLEENNAAMMEE::LLIINNEENNOO.  By default
       each input address generates one line of output.

       Two options can generate additional lines before each
       FFIILLEENNAAMMEE::LLIINNEENNOO line (in that order).

       If the --aa option is used then a line with the input
       address is displayed.

       If the --ff option is used, then a line with the
       FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNNNAAMMEE is displayed.  This is the name of the
       function containing the address.

       One option can generate additional lines after the

       FFIILLEENNAAMMEE::LLIINNEENNOO line.

       If the --ii option is used and the code at the given address
       is present there because of inlining by the compiler then
       additional lines are displayed afterwards.  One or two
       extra lines (if the --ff option is used) are displayed for
       each inlined function.

       Alternatively if the --pp option is used then each input
       address generates a single, long, output line containing
       the address, the function name, the file name and the line
       number.  If the --ii option has also been used then any
       inlined functions will be displayed in the same manner,
       but on separate lines, and prefixed by the text ((iinnlliinneedd
       bbyy)).

       If the file name or function name can not be determined,
       aaddddrr22lliinnee will print two question marks in their place.
       If the line number can not be determined, aaddddrr22lliinnee will
       print 0.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as
       alternatives, are equivalent.

       --aa
       ----aaddddrreesssseess
           Display the address before the function name, file and
           line number information.  The address is printed with
           a 00xx prefix to easily identify it.

       --bb _b_f_d_n_a_m_e
       ----ttaarrggeett==_b_f_d_n_a_m_e
           Specify that the object-code format for the object
           files is _b_f_d_n_a_m_e.

       --CC
       ----ddeemmaannggllee[[==_s_t_y_l_e]]
           Decode (_d_e_m_a_n_g_l_e) low-level symbol names into user-
           level names.  Besides removing any initial underscore
           prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names
           readable.  Different compilers have different mangling
           styles. The optional demangling style argument can be
           used to choose an appropriate demangling style for
           your compiler.

       --ee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
       ----eexxee==_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses
           should be translated.  The default file is _a_._o_u_t.

       --ff
       ----ffuunnccttiioonnss
           Display function names as well as file and line number

           information.

       --ss
       ----bbaasseennaammeess
           Display only the base of each file name.

       --ii
       ----iinnlliinneess
           If the address belongs to a function that was inlined,
           the source information for all enclosing scopes back
           to the first non-inlined function will also be
           printed.  For example, if "main" inlines "callee1"
           which inlines "callee2", and address is from
           "callee2", the source information for "callee1" and
           "main" will also be printed.

       --jj
       ----sseeccttiioonn
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead
           of absolute addresses.

       --pp
       ----pprreettttyy--pprriinntt
           Make the output more human friendly: each location are
           printed on one line.  If option --ii is specified, lines
           for all enclosing scopes are prefixed with ((iinnlliinneedd
           bbyy)).

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are inserted in place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.
           If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or cannot be read, then the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in _f_i_l_e are separated by whitespace.  A
           whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in either single or
           double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included by prefixing the character to be
           included with a backslash.  The _f_i_l_e may itself
           contain additional @_f_i_l_e options; any such options
           will be processed recursively.
