       ggddbbsseerrvveerr  is  a  program  that allows you to run GDB on a
       different machine  than  the  one  which  is  running  the
       program being debugged.

       Usage (server (target) side):

       First,  you need to have a copy of the program you want to
       debug put onto the target  system.   The  program  can  be
       stripped  to  save  space  if needed, as ggddbbsseerrvveerr doesn't
       care about symbols.  All symbol handling is taken care  of
       by the GDB running on the host system.

       To  use  the  server, you log on to the target system, and
       run the ggddbbsseerrvveerr program.  You must tell it  (a)  how  to
       communicate  with  GDB,  (b) the name of your program, and
       (c) its arguments.  The general syntax is:

               target> gdbserver <comm> <program> [<args> ...]

       For example, using a serial port, you might say:

               target> gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt

       This tells ggddbbsseerrvveerr to debug emacs with  an  argument  of
       foo.txt,  and  to  communicate  with  GDB  via  _/_d_e_v_/_c_o_m_1.
       ggddbbsseerrvveerr  now  waits  patiently  for  the  host  GDB   to
       communicate with it.

       To use a TCP connection, you could say:

               target> gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt

       This  says pretty much the same thing as the last example,
       except that we are going to communicate  with  the  "host"
       GDB  via  TCP.  The "host:2345" argument means that we are
       expecting to see a TCP connection from "host" to local TCP
       port  2345.  (Currently, the "host" part is ignored.)  You
       can choose any number you want for the port number as long
       as it does not conflict with any existing TCP ports on the
       target system.  This same port number must be used in  the
       host GDBs "target remote" command, which will be described
       shortly.  Note that  if  you  chose  a  port  number  that
       conflicts  with  another  service, ggddbbsseerrvveerr will print an

       error message and exit.

       ggddbbsseerrvveerr can also attach to running  programs.   This  is
       accomplished via the ----aattttaacchh argument.  The syntax is:

               target> gdbserver --attach <comm> <pid>

       _p_i_d  is the process ID of a currently running process.  It
       isn't necessary to point ggddbbsseerrvveerr at  a  binary  for  the
       running process.

       To  start "gdbserver" without supplying an initial command
       to run or process ID to attach, use  the  ----mmuullttii  command
       line  option.   In  such  case  you  should  connect using
       "target extended-remote" to start the program you want  to
       debug.

               target> gdbserver --multi <comm>

       Usage (host side):

       You  need an unstripped copy of the target program on your
       host system, since GDB needs to examine it's symbol tables
       and  such.   Start  up GDB as you normally would, with the
       target program as the first argument.  (You  may  need  to
       use  the  ----bbaauudd  option  if the serial line is running at
       anything except 9600 baud.)  That is "gdb TARGET-PROG", or
       "gdb  --baud  BAUD TARGET-PROG".  After that, the only new
       command you need to know  about  is  "target  remote"  (or
       "target  extended-remote").   Its  argument  is  either  a
       device name (usually a serial device, like _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_b),  or
       a "HOST:PORT" descriptor.  For example:

               (gdb) target remote /dev/ttyb

       communicates  with  the  server via serial line _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_b,
       and:

               (gdb) target remote the-target:2345

       communicates via a TCP connection to  port  2345  on  host
       `the-target',  where  you  previously started up ggddbbsseerrvveerr
       with the same port number.  Note that for TCP connections,
       you  must  start  up  ggddbbsseerrvveerr prior to using the `target
       remote' command, otherwise you may get an error that looks
       something like `Connection refused'.

       ggddbbsseerrvveerr  can  also  debug  multiple  inferiors  at once,
       described  in  the  GDB  manual  in  node  "Inferiors  and
       Programs"  -- shell command "info -f gdb -n 'Inferiors and
       Programs'".  In such case use  the  "extended-remote"  GDB
       command variant:

               (gdb) target extended-remote the-target:2345

GDBSERVER(1)          GNU Development Tools          GDBSERVER(1)


       The  ggddbbsseerrvveerr  option  ----mmuullttii  may or may not be used in
       such case.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       There are three different modes for invoking ggddbbsseerrvveerr:

       +o   Debug a specific  program  specified  by  its  program
           name:

                   gdbserver <comm> <prog> [<args>...]

           The  _c_o_m_m  parameter  specifies  how should the server
           communicate with GDB; it is either a device  name  (to
           use  a  serial  line), a TCP port number (":1234"), or
           "-" or "stdio" to  use  stdin/stdout  of  "gdbserver".
           Specify the name of the program to debug in _p_r_o_g.  Any
           remaining arguments will  be  passed  to  the  program
           verbatim.   When the program exits, GDB will close the
           connection, and "gdbserver" will exit.

       +o   Debug a specific program by specifying the process  ID
           of a running program:

                   gdbserver --attach <comm> <pid>

           The  _c_o_m_m parameter is as described above.  Supply the
           process ID of a running program in _p_i_d;  GDB  will  do
           everything  else.   Like  with the previous mode, when
           the process _p_i_d exits, GDB will close the  connection,
           and "gdbserver" will exit.

       +o   Multi-process    mode   --   debug   more   than   one
           program/process:

                   gdbserver --multi <comm>

           In  this  mode,  GDB  can  instruct  ggddbbsseerrvveerr   which
           command(s) to run.  Unlike the other 2 modes, GDB will
           not close the connection when a process being debugged
           exits,  so you can debug several processes in the same
           session.

       In each of the modes you may specify these options:

       ----hheellpp
           List all options, with brief explanations.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
           This option causes  ggddbbsseerrvveerr  to  print  its  version
           number and exit.

       ----aattttaacchh
           ggddbbsseerrvveerr  will  attach  to  a  running  program.  The
           syntax is:



gdb-7.9.1                   2015-07-02                          3

                   target> gdbserver --attach <comm> <pid>

           _p_i_d is the process ID of a currently running  process.
           It  isn't necessary to point ggddbbsseerrvveerr at a binary for
           the running process.

       ----mmuullttii
           To start  "gdbserver"  without  supplying  an  initial
           command  to  run  or  process  ID  to attach, use this
           command line  option.   Then  you  can  connect  using
           "target  extended-remote"  and  start  the program you
           want to debug.  The syntax is:

                   target> gdbserver --multi <comm>

       ----ddeebbuugg
           Instruct   "gdbserver"   to   display   extra   status
           information  about the debugging process.  This option
           is intended for "gdbserver" development  and  for  bug
           reports to the developers.

       ----rreemmoottee--ddeebbuugg
           Instruct  "gdbserver" to display remote protocol debug
           output.   This  option  is  intended  for  "gdbserver"
           development and for bug reports to the developers.

       ----ddeebbuugg--ffoorrmmaatt==ooppttiioonn11[,,ooppttiioonn22,,......]
           Instruct  "gdbserver"  to include extra information in
           each line of debugging output.

       ----wwrraappppeerr
           Specify a wrapper to launch  programs  for  debugging.
           The  option  should  be  followed  by  the name of the
           wrapper, then any command-line arguments  to  pass  to
           the  wrapper,  then  "--"  indicating  the  end of the
           wrapper arguments.

       ----oonnccee
           By default, ggddbbsseerrvveerr keeps  the  listening  TCP  port
           open,  so  that  additional  connections are possible.
           However, if you  start  "gdbserver"  with  the  ----oonnccee
           option,   it  will  stop  listening  for  any  further
           connection attempts after connecting to the first  GDB
           session.

       The  full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo
       manual.  If  the  "info"  and  "gdb"  programs  and  GDB's
       Texinfo documentation are properly installed at your site,
       the command

               info gdb

       should give you access to the complete manual.
