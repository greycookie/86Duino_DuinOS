       For each _f_i_l_e given, GNU ssttrriinnggss prints the printable
       character sequences that are at least 4 characters long
       (or the number given with the options below) and are
       followed by an unprintable character.

       Depending upon how the strings program was configured it
       will default to either displaying all the printable
       sequences that it can find in each file, or only those
       sequences that are in loadable, initialized data sections.
       If the file type in unrecognizable, or if strings is
       reading from stdin then it will always display all of the
       printable sequences that it can find.

       For backwards compatibility any file that occurs after a
       command line option of just -- will also be scanned in
       full, regardless of the presence of any --dd option.

       ssttrriinnggss is mainly useful for determining the contents of
       non-text files.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa
       ----aallll
       --   Scan the whole file, regardless of what sections it
           contains or whether those sections are loaded or
           initialized.  Normally this is the default behaviour,
           but strings can be configured so that the --dd is the
           default instead.

           The -- option is position dependent and forces strings
           to perform full scans of any file that is mentioned
           after the -- on the command line, even if the --dd option
           has been specified.

       --dd
       ----ddaattaa
           Only print strings from initialized, loaded data
           sections in the file.  This may reduce the amount of
           garbage in the output, but it also exposes the strings

           program to any security flaws that may be present in
           the BFD library used to scan and load sections.
           Strings can be configured so that this option is the
           default behaviour.  In such cases the --aa option can be
           used to avoid using the BFD library and instead just
           print all of the strings found in the file.

       --ff
       ----pprriinntt--ffiillee--nnaammee
           Print the name of the file before each string.

       ----hheellpp
           Print a summary of the program usage on the standard
           output and exit.

       --_m_i_n_-_l_e_n
       --nn _m_i_n_-_l_e_n
       ----bbyytteess==_m_i_n_-_l_e_n
           Print sequences of characters that are at least _m_i_n_-
           _l_e_n characters long, instead of the default 4.

       --oo  Like --tt oo.  Some other versions of ssttrriinnggss have --oo act
           like --tt dd instead.  Since we can not be compatible
           with both ways, we simply chose one.

       --tt _r_a_d_i_x
       ----rraaddiixx==_r_a_d_i_x
           Print the offset within the file before each string.
           The single character argument specifies the radix of
           the offset---oo for octal, xx for hexadecimal, or dd for
           decimal.

       --ee _e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g
       ----eennccooddiinngg==_e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g
           Select the character encoding of the strings that are
           to be found.  Possible values for _e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g are: ss =
           single-7-bit-byte characters (ASCII, ISO 8859, etc.,
           default), SS = single-8-bit-byte characters, bb = 16-bit
           bigendian, ll = 16-bit littleendian, BB = 32-bit
           bigendian, LL = 32-bit littleendian.  Useful for
           finding wide character strings. (ll and bb apply to, for
           example, Unicode UTF-16/UCS-2 encodings).

       --TT _b_f_d_n_a_m_e
       ----ttaarrggeett==_b_f_d_n_a_m_e
           Specify an object code format other than your system's
           default format.

       --vv
       --VV
       ----vveerrssiioonn
           Print the program version number on the standard
           output and exit.

       --ww
       ----iinncclluuddee--aallll--wwhhiitteessppaaccee
           By default tab and space characters are included in
           the strings that are displayed, but other whitespace
           characters, such a newlines and carriage returns, are
           not.  The --ww option changes this so that all
           whitespace characters are considered to be part of a
           string.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are inserted in place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.
           If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or cannot be read, then the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in _f_i_l_e are separated by whitespace.  A
           whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in either single or
           double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included by prefixing the character to be
           included with a backslash.  The _f_i_l_e may itself
           contain additional @_f_i_l_e options; any such options
           will be processed recursively.
